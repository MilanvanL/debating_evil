# Debating Evil
This repository contains the code (R) of the paper 'Debating Evil: Using Word Embeddings to Analyse Parliamentary Debates on War Criminals in the Netherlands'.

You can start with training models based on your own dataset/.txt-file (1_train_WEMs.R) and analyse them (2_analyse_plot_WEMs.R). You can also directly download the trained .bin-files (vecs_1945-55.bin and vecs_1965-75.bin) and analyse them with the second script (2_analyse_plot_WEMs.R). 

Our trained models are based on the PoliticalMashup and Dutch Parliamentary Proceedings dataset. *
