# Debating Evil
This repository contains the code (R) of the paper 'Debating Evil: Using Word Embeddings to Analyse Parliamentary Debates on War Criminals in the Netherlands'.

To replicate our analysis and plotting of the results, you can download the trained .bin-files (vecs_1945-55.bin and vecs_1965-75.bin) and analyse them with the second script (2_analyse_plot_WEMs.R). Of course, you can also train new Word Embedding Models based on your own dataset/.txt-file with the first script (1_train_WEMs.R) and analyse them with the second (2_analyse_plot_WEMs.R). We use the wordVectors package by Benjamin Schmidt and the magrittr forward-pipe operator package by Stefan Milton Bache and Hadley Wickham. 

Our trained models are based on the PoliticalMashup and Dutch Parliamentary Proceedings dataset. Marx, Dr. M. (Informatics Institute, University of Amsterdam); Doornik, Dr. Ir.
